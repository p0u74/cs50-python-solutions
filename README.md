## 🛠️ Usage

Each folder corresponds to a week in the course. Inside, you will find individual python files for each problem.

```bash
# Example: Running the 'indoor' solution from Week 0
cd week0
python indoor.py
```

## 🧪 Testing

Some solutions include unit tests using `pytest`. To run them:

```bash
# Navigate to the week folder
cd week5
# Run pytest
pytest test_bank.py
```
